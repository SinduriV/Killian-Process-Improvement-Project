# Kilian Manufacturing Process Improvement  
*SCM 755 Final Project*

## üè≠ Overview

This project aimed to significantly improve operational efficiency and delivery performance at **Kilian Manufacturing**, a Regal Rexnord company in Syracuse, NY. The initiative focused on redesigning production workflows, optimizing work cells, and implementing lean manufacturing principles to raise on-time delivery efficiency from **80% to 99.97%**.

Through a combination of **Visual Delivery Management dashboards**, **work cell reconfiguration**, and **lean training**, the team achieved measurable improvements in cycle time, resource utilization, and customer satisfaction.

## üìç Business Case

Kilian faced several operational bottlenecks:
- Inefficient resource utilization (80% efficiency)
- Inventory delays and poor communication across shifts
- No real-time visibility into production metrics

By redesigning work cells, training employees, and visualizing performance via dashboards, the project targeted improvements in:
- Efficiency (target: **99.97%**)
- Inventory turnover
- Lead times
- Customer satisfaction
